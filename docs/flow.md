# Flow log

A running record of what has been done on toshi-way, in order, and why. Newest entries go at the bottom. See [project.md](project.md) for the overall spec.

## 1. Reviewed the PRD

Read the HODL-invoice escrow PRD and gave feedback. Main points:

- Strengths: build the node integration first, node events are the source of truth, 256-bit preimage, and the refund demo.
- Concerns: the buyer holds all the power (they can withhold `P` and still get refunded), so delivery is the strongest use case. Requiring sellers to run a hold-invoice-capable node excludes most people, so the service may need to host the seller node. Hold times of "a day or two" are optimistic. The stack is heavy for a hackathon.
- Decision: do Phase 1 (prove the hold-invoice cycle) before any API or UI.

## 2. Chose a regtest setup without Polar

Polar is a desktop GUI around Docker containers and isn't available in this WSL environment. Checked the machine and found Docker 29.8.1, Docker Compose v5.5.1, Rust (cargo/rustc), Node and Python 3 already installed (no `jq`, so the scripts parse JSON with Python).

Decision: replace Polar with a plain `docker-compose.yml` plus a setup script, kept in the repo so the network is reproducible with one command.

## 3. Built the regtest network

Files added under `regtest/`:

- `docker-compose.yml`: one `bitcoind` (`lncm/bitcoind:v27.0`, regtest, ZMQ enabled) and three LND nodes (`lightninglabs/lnd:v0.18.5-beta`) named `buyer`, `router` and `seller`. gRPC is published on host ports 10001 / 10002 / 10003, REST on 8081 / 8082 / 8083. Each node has its own named volume.
- `setup.sh`: starts the containers, creates a miner wallet and mines 101 blocks, waits for each node to sync, funds each node with 1 BTC, opens channels `buyer → router` and `router → seller` (500,000 sats each, 100,000 pushed to the far side), waits for them to become active, and exports each node's `tls.cert` and `admin.macaroon` to `regtest/creds/<node>/`. Safe to re-run: it skips channels that already exist.
- `.gitignore`: excludes `regtest/creds/`, `target/`, `node_modules/` and `.env`.

One snag: my first compose file used YAML anchors to share the LND flags, but anchors can't splice a list into a `command`, so Compose rejected it. I generated the file with each node's flags written out in full instead.

## 4. Verified the network

- A normal 1000-sat invoice from `seller` was paid by `buyer` through `router`. Result: seller invoice `SETTLED`, buyer payment `SUCCEEDED` with a 1-sat routing fee. This proves the channels are open and the route works.
- `addholdinvoice` on `seller` for a random 32-byte preimage hash returned a payment request, and the invoice sits in `OPEN` state. This proves the hold-invoice RPC is available in this LND build.

Nothing here has been committed to git yet.

## 5. Wrote the docs

- `docs/project.md`: condensed project spec (concept, modes, state machine, architecture, API, milestones, demo script, regtest instructions, status).
- `docs/flow.md`: this file.

## 6. Built and ran Phase 1 (`phase1/`)

A Cargo workspace (`Cargo.toml`) with one binary crate, `phase1`. Run it with `cargo run -p phase1 -- [settle|cancel|both]` after `./regtest/setup.sh`.

What it does: one program plays buyer and seller against the real LND nodes. The buyer side generates a random 32-byte `P` and `H = sha256(P)`. The seller node creates a hold invoice for `H` (1000 sats). The buyer node pays it through the router in a background task. The program watches the seller's invoice stream and waits for `ACCEPTED`, then either settles with `P` (after re-checking `sha256(P) == H`) or cancels. It then checks the payment status and channel balances.

Build notes:

- `tonic_lnd` 0.5.1 only exposes the lightning, wallet, signer and peers services, so it has no invoices or router. Switched to `fedimint-tonic-lnd` 0.4 with the `invoicesrpc` and `routerrpc` features.
- Its build needs `protoc`, which wasn't installed. Put protoc 28.3 in `~/.local/bin` (no sudo).
- The first run panicked because rustls had no crypto provider selected. Added `rustls` with the `ring` feature and installed it at startup.

### Results (both scenarios pass)

Settle path:

| Step | Seller invoice | Buyer payment | Buyer / seller balance |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| before | - | - | 395528 / 101000 |
| paid, held | `OPEN` then `ACCEPTED` | in flight | 394097 / 101000 |
| settled with `P` | `SETTLED` | `Succeeded` | 394527 / 102000 |

Cancel path:

| Step | Seller invoice | Buyer payment | Buyer / seller balance |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| before | - | - | 394527 / 102000 |
| paid, held | `OPEN` then `ACCEPTED` | in flight | 393096 / 102000 |
| cancelled | `CANCELED` | `Failed` (reason 4, incorrect payment details) | 394527 / 102000 |

### What this tells us

- The lock is real: while the invoice is `ACCEPTED` the buyer's balance has already dropped and the seller's has not moved. The money is committed but not spent.
- Settle works: the seller gains exactly 1000 sats and the buyer pays 1000 plus a 1-sat routing fee.
- Cancel refunds in full: the buyer's balance returns exactly to its starting value, fee included, and the seller is unchanged.
- The node's invoice stream emits states in the order `OPEN`, `ACCEPTED`, then `SETTLED` or `CANCELED`. The Lightning adapter and the escrow state machine should be driven by these events.
- A cancelled hold shows up on the buyer side as a failed payment with `FAILURE_REASON_INCORRECT_PAYMENT_DETAILS`. The core should treat that as the refund signal, not as an error.
- The balance seen by the buyer while held is about 430 sats lower than the final cost. Part of that is channel reserve and commitment fee accounting, not payment. Don't use the buyer's channel balance as proof of lock; use the invoice state.

Not yet tested: the timeout path where nobody acts and the HTLC expires on its own (needs mined blocks), hold behaviour across a node restart, and wrong-preimage handling.

## Next

Test the timeout path on regtest (mine blocks past the HTLC expiry, record the CLTV and expiry values to use), then start Phase 2: the escrow core behind a `LightningAdapter` trait, the state machine and the database schema.
